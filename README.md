## Introduction
**ft_printf** is the second project I did for 42 School.

This project consists in reproducing the real printf function. Our printf has to handle %s, %d, %i, %p, %u, %x, %X.

In the bonus version of the project, it must handle more parameters, but I didn't do the bonus for this project.

## How to use ?
First, clone the ft_printf repository with:
```bash
  git clone https://github.com/Arawyn42/42_ft_printf
```

The Makefile allows to create a small library to include ft_printf in another project. But like there are only 2 .c files, the best use is to paste it in the project where you want ft_printf and to change the includes at the beginning of the files.

To make the libftprintf.a file, you can type the following commands:
```bash
make
make clean
```
Then you just need to compile your program with the libftprintf.a
